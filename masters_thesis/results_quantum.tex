\section{Quantum Clustering}

This section presents performance and validity results of Quantum K-Means and Horn and Gottlieb's algorithm.
All results were obtained using machine Alpha.

\subsection{Quantum K-Means}

The testing was aimed at benchmarking both accuracy and speed.
The input used was synthetic data, namely, Gaussian mixtures with variable number of clusters and features.

The tests were performed using 10 oracles, a qubit string length of 8 and 100 generations per round.
The classical K-Means was executed using the \emph{k-means++} centroid initialization method to make for a fairer comparison, since QK-Means performs several operations (initialization and collapse of oracles) at the beginning of the algorithm.
Furthermore, the performance results for K-Means alone refer to $num.oracles \times num.generations \times factor$ runs, where $factor$ is an adjustable multiplier.
Each test had 20 rounds to allow for statistical analysis of the results. %, since QK-Means executes a classical K-Means for each oracle each generation,
The stopping criteria for all classical K-Means runs was the error between the centroids of two subsequent iterations, more specifically, when the centroids of two iterations differed by less than $0.001$.

All tests were done with 6 clusters (natural number of clusters).
Two tests were done with the two dimensional dataset: one with a $factor=1.10$ (increase initializations by $10\%$) and another with $factor=1$.
These tests will be called T1 and T2, respectively.
The test was done with the six dimensional dataset (T3) using $factor=1.10$.

Performance results are presented in Table \ref{tab:qkmeans times}.
The mean computation time of classical K-Means is an order of magnitude lower than that of QK-Means.
However, the solution chosen in classical K-Means was the one with lowest sum of squared euclidean distances of points to their attributed centroid.
To analyze the influence of the Davies-Bouldin (DB) index, it was computed on all classical K-Means solutions and used as the criteria to choose the best solution.
When this is done, we can see in Table \ref{tab:qkmeans times} that the total time of classical K-Means is actually higher that that of QK-Means in T1 and T3, but this is only due to the 1.10 multiplier on the number of initializations.
In T2, the computation times become very similar with only a 2\% difference between these two variants.
Results show that most computational cost (88\% on T2) lies on the evaluation of the solutions obtained from each oracle, i.e. computing the DB index.
This is a costly but necessary step in this algorithm.

DB index results are presented in Table \ref{tab:qkmeans DB}.
These results show that the quality of the solutions from K-Means and QK-Means do not differ significantly on these datasets.
The results presented before steered the direction of the analysis to a "fairer" comparison.
Yet, the main requirement for the target application of this algorithm is speed.
In this regard, it is several orders of magnitude slower than the classical K-Means, since the K-Means performance results refer to many runs.
This, allied with the fact that the quality of the solutions does not differ much in the two algorithms and the fact that good quality is not necessary in the target application, makes the use of this algorithm prohibitive in the EAC context.

% \subsubsection{QK-Means details}

% Here we’ll analyse a bit what’s happening within each QK-Means execution. One would expect for the population’s fitness variance to decrease over the generations, as the probabilities for previous known solutions increase and are therefore more likely to reappear. The convergence of the population mean would also be expected to decrease for the same reason. However, experimental (Fig. \ref{fig:db_index_mean_t2} and \ref{fig:db_index_var_t2}) results don’t suggest any of these expectations (the results of T1 and T3 suggest the same). This may be due to low number of generations or simply because the random generation of initial centroids isn’t influenced enough by the qubit probabilities.

% Analysing the evolution of the DB index of the best solution over the generations (Fig. \ref{fig:qk_db_index_best_evo_t2} and \ref{fig:qk_db_index_best_evo_t3}) gives some insight on the rate of convergence. In both tests it is clear that the best solution is often reached in a quarter of the total generations. More detail can be seen in the Table \ref{tab:db_index_t1_t3}.

\subsection{Horn and Gottlieb's algorithm}

For measuring the performance of Horn and Gottlieb's algorithm, several mixtures of 4 Gaussians with different number of patterns and dimensions were produced. %cardinality and dimensionality were produced.
Table \ref{tab:horn performance} presents the execution times for each of these datasets.
It can be seen that the execution time of this algorithm is rather high even for small datasets as the ones presented, since this algorithm is being analyzed with the goal of speed optimization.
More than 1 hour for a small dataset such as $10 \: 000$ patterns is prohibitive for application in the EAC context.

In spite of its computational complexity, the accuracy of the algorithm was tested on the Iris and Crab datasets, taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository \cite{Lichman:2013}.
The Iris dataset has 150 patterns, 4 features and 3 classes where 2 are overlapping.
The Crab dataset has 200 patterns, 5 features and 4 classes where 2 pairs of classes are overlapping.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to both datasets before clustering.
An accuracy as high as $86\%$ was obtained for the Iris dataset when using the first and second principal components (PC), and as high as $82\%$ when using all PCs.
For the Crab dataset an accuracy of $81.5\%$ was obtained for the second and third PCs (PCs chosen to reproduce the results of the original source of the algorithm), $63\%$ when using all PCs.
However, when applied to the unprocessed data the accuracy was only $34\%$ .

% Initial work aimed at reproducing results from [2], but lack of detail on the preprocessing used made it an harder task. Several preprocessings were used, namely whitening or not the data, centring it or not, using covariance versus correlation and different methods of computing the PCs through eigenvalue decomposition or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The closest representation to that of the [2] is the one if Fig. C1.
