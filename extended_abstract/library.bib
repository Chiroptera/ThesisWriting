abstract = {On one hand, image segmentation is a low-level processing task which consists in partitioning an image into homogeneous regions. It can be seen as being a combinatorial optimization problem. In fact, considering the huge amount of information that an image carries, it is impossible to find the best segmentation. On the other hand, quantum genetic algorithms are characterized by their high diversity, and by a good balance between global and local search. In this paper, we present a quantum genetic algorithm for image segmentation},

abstract = {We address the problem of clustering of contour images from hardware tools based on string descriptions, in a comparative study of cluster combination techniques. Several clustering algorithms are addressed using both the hierarchical agglomerative concept and partitional approaches. In the later class of algorithms, we explore: an adaptation of the K-means algorithm to string patterns using the median string as cluster representative; the error-correcting parsing approach by Fu; and the very recent spectral clustering approach. These algorithms are applied using several dissimilarity measures, namely: minimum code length based measures; dissimilarity based on the concept of reduction in grammatical complexity; and error-correcting parsing. In a first instance, clustering algorithms are applied individually to the image data set, and results are evaluated in terms of the error rate, taking as ground truth known labeling of the data. In a second step, we combine multiple data partitions, that we call a clustering ensemble, using three state-of-the-art clustering combination techniques. Results show that combination methods lead in general to better data partitioning, as compared to ground truth information.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The microarray technology is increasingly being applied in biological and medical research to address a wide range of problems such as the classification of tumors. An important statistical question associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene expression profiles. Essential aspects of this clustering problem include identifying accurate partitions of the tumor samples into clusters and assessing the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. RESULTS: Two new resampling methods, inspired from bagging in prediction, are proposed to improve and assess the accuracy of a given clustering procedure. In these ensemble methods, a partitioning clustering procedure is applied to bootstrap learning sets and the resulting multiple partitions are combined by voting or the creation of a new dissimilarity matrix. As in prediction, the motivation behind bagging is to reduce variability in the partitioning results via averaging. The performances of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene expression data from two recently published cancer microarray studies. The bagged clustering procedures were in general at least as accurate and often substantially more accurate than a single application of the partitioning clustering procedure. A valuable by-product of bagged clustering are the cluster votes which can be used to assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual observations.

abstract = {The analysis of climate data has relied heavily on hypothesis-driven statistical methods, while projections of future climate are based primarily on physics-based computational models. However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The conventional k-means clustering algorithm must know the number of clusters in advance and the clustering result is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centroids. The sensitivity may make the algorithm converge to the local optima. This paper proposes an improved k-means clustering algorithm based on quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (KMQGA). In KMQGA, Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as three genetic algorithm operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bit. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, the KMQGA can get the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids after several iterations of the four operations (selection, crossover, mutation, and rotation). The simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA and to compare KMQGA with an improved k-means clustering algorithm based on the famous variable string length genetic algorithm (KMVGA) respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and the effectiveness and the search quality of KMQGA is better than those of KMVGA.},

abstract = {The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

abstract = {Experienced algorithm designers rely heavily on a set of building blocks and on the tools needed to put the blocks together into an algorithm. The understanding of these basic blocks and tools is therefore critical to the understanding of algorithms. Many of the blocks and tools needed for parallel algorithms extend from sequential algorithms, such as dynamic-programming and divide-and-conquer, but others are new. This paper introduces one of the simplest and most useful building blocks for parallel algorithms: the all-prefix-sums operation. The paper defines the operation, shows how to implement it on a PRAM and illustrates many applications of the operation. In addition to being a useful building block, the all-prefix-sums operation is a good example of a computation that seems inherently sequential, but for which there is an efficient parallel algorithm.},

GQA is based on the concept and principles of quantum computing such as qubits and superposition of states. Instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, by adopting qubit chromosome as a representation GQA can represent a linear superposition of solutions due to its probabilistic representation. As genetic operators, quantum gates are employed for the search of the best solution. Rapid convergence and good global search capability characterize the performance of GQA. The effectiveness and the applicability of GQA are demonstrated by experimental results on the knapsack problem, which is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The results show that GQA is superior to other genetic algorithms using penalty functions, repair methods and decoders},

On the other hand, the arrival of CUDA has unveiled the extraordinary power of Graphics Processors (GPUs) to accelerate data intensive general purpose computing more and more as times goes by. This work takes these two emerging trends to benefit side by side during the development of a high performance version for a biomedical application of growing popularity: gene expression normalization. A variety of experimental issues are analyzed for this execution, including cost, performance and scalability of the graphics architecture on three different platforms. Our study reveals advantages and drawbacks of using the GPU as target hardware, providing lessons to benefit a broad set of existing genetic applications, either based on those pillars or having similarities with their procedures.},

We introduce three optimizations: a packetized formulation, a technique for restarting partially down the tree instead of at the root, and a small, fixed-size stack that is checked before resorting to restart. Our optimized implementation achieves 15 - 18 million primary rays per second and 16 - 27 million shadow rays per second on our test scenes. Our system also takes advantage of GPUs strengths at rasterization and shading to offer a mode where rasterization replaces eye ray scene intersection, and primary hits and lo- cal shading are produced with standard Direct3D code. For 1024x1024 renderings of our scenes with shadows and Phong shading, we achieve 12-18 frames per second. Finally, we in- vestigate the efficiency of our implementation relative to the computational resources of our GPUs and also compare it against conventional CPUs and the Cell processor, which both have been shown to raytrace well.},

abstract = {Given an arbitrary data set, to which no particular paramet- rical, statistical or geometrical structure can be assumed, different clus- tering algorithms will in general produce different data partitions. In fact, several partitions can also be obtained by using a single clustering algo- rithm due to dependencies on initialization or the selection of the value of some design parameter. This paper addresses the problem of finding consistent clusters in data partitions, proposing the analysis of the most common associations performed in a majority voting scheme. Combina- tion of clustering results are performed by transforming data partitions into a co-association sample matrix, which maps coherent associations. This matrix is then used to extract the underlying consistent clusters. The proposed methodology is evaluated in the context of k-means clus- tering, a new clustering algorithm - voting-k-means, being presented. Examples, using both simulated and real data, show how this major- ity voting combination scheme simultaneously handles the problems of selecting the number of clusters, and dependency on initialization. Fur- thermore, resulting clusters are not constrained to be hyper-spherically shaped.},

abstract = {Given a data set, a dynamical procedure is applied to the data points in order to shrink and separate, possibly overlapping clusters. Namely, Newton's equations of motion are employed to concentrate the data points around their cluster centers, using an attractive potential, constructed specially for this purpose. During this process, important information is gathered concerning the spread of each cluster. In succession this information is used to create an objective function that maps each cluster to a local maximum. Global optimization is then used to retrieve the positions of the maxima that correspond to the locations of the cluster centers. Further refinement is achieved by applying the EM-algorithm to a Gaussian mixture model whose construction and initialization is based on the acquired information. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted experiments on a plethora of benchmark data sets. In addition we have compared its performance against four clustering techniques that are well established in the literature. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

The novelty of our approach is the study of an operator in Hilbert space, represented by the Schr¨ odinger equation of which the probability function is a solution. This Schr¨ odinger equation contains a potential function that can be derived analytically from the probability function. We associate minima of the potential with cluster centers. Themethod has one variable parameter, the scale of its Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate its applicability on known data sets. By limiting the evaluation of the Schr¨ odinger potential to the locations of data points, we can apply this method to problems in high dimensions. 1},

The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering \$\{\backslash cal C\}\$ to clustering \$\{\backslash cal C\}'\$ . The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings. Keywords: Clustering; Comparing partitions; Measures of agreement; Information theory; Mutual information},

abstract = {Recommendation systems are a popular marketing strategy for online service providers. These systems predict a customer's future preferences from the past behaviors of that customer and the other customers. Most of the popular online stores process millions of transactions per day; therefore, providing quick and quality recommendations using the large amount of data collected from past transactions can be challenging. Parallel processing power of GPUs can be used to accelerate the recommendation process. However, the amount of memory available on a GPU card is limited; thus, a number of passes may be required to completely process a large-scale dataset. This paper proposes two parallel, item-based recommendation algorithms implemented using the CUDA platform. Considering the high sparsity of the user-item data, we utilize two compression techniques to reduce the required number of passes and increase the speedup. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our algorithms outperform the respective CPU implementations and also the na\~{A}¯ve GPU implementation which does not use compression. \^{A}© 2013 IEEE.},

One limitation of this method of data clustering is its complexity \$O(n\^{}2)\$. As the number of data and feature dimensions grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate results in a reasonable amount of time. In the last few years, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has received attention for its ability to solve highly-parallel and semi-parallel problems much faster than the traditional sequential processor. In this chapter, we have conducted research to exploit this architecture and apply its strengths to the flocking based data clustering problem. Using the CUDA platform from NVIDIA, we developed a Multiple Species Data Flocking implementation to be run on the NVIDIA GPU. Performance gains ranged from \$30\$ to \$60\$ times improvement of the GPU over the CPU implementation.},

In this paper, we present an algorithm called voting partition affinity propagation (voting-PAP) which is a method for clustering using evidence accumulation based on AP. Resulting clusters by voting-PAP are not constrained to be hyper-spherically shaped. Voting-PAP consists of three parts: partition affinity propagation (PAP), relaxed multi-root minimum spanning tree (MST) and majority voting. PAP is a method which can produce different exemplar set based on AP. Relaxed multi-root MST is a data point assign algorithm which has better performance than nearest assign rule. Majority voting is a scheme used to find a consistent clustering result of different partitions based on the idea of evidence accumulation. We also discuss how to find an appropriate threshold corresponding to an approximate ideal consistent partition in this paper.},

abstract = {Exascale science translates to big data. In the case of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the data is not only immense, it is also globally distributed. Fermilab is host to the LHC Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment's US Tier-1 Center, the largest of the LHC Tier-1s. The Laboratory must deal with both scaling and wide-area distribution challenges in processing its CMS data. Fortunately, evolving technologies in the form of 100Gigabit ethernet, multi-core architectures, and GPU processing provide tools to help meet these challenges. Current Fermilab R\&amp;D efforts in these areas include optimization of network I/O handling in multi-core systems, modification of middleware to improve application performance in 100GE network environments, and network path reconfiguration and analysis for effective use of high bandwidth networks. This poster will describe the ongoing network-related R\&amp;D activities at Fermilab as a mosaic of efforts that combine to facilitate big data processing and movement. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We often observe this phenomena when applying K-Means to datasets where the number of dimensions is n 10 and the number of desired clusters is k 20. We propose explicitly adding k constraints to the underlying clustering optimization problem requiring that each cluster have at least a minimum number of points in it. We then investigate the resulting cluster assignment step. Preliminary numerical tests on real datasets indicate the constrained approach is less prone to poor local solutions, producing a better summary of the underlying data.},

abstract = {Clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions of the given data into a single clustering solution of better quality. Inspired by the success of supervised boosting algorithms, we devise an adaptive scheme for integration of multiple non-independent clusterings. Individual partitions in the ensemble are sequentially generated by clustering specially selected subsamples of the given data set. The sampling probability for each data point dynamically depends on the consistency of its previous assignments in the ensemble. New subsamples are drawn to increasingly focus on the problematic regions of the input feature space. A measure of a data point's clustering consistency is defined to guide this adaptation. An empirical study compares the performance of adaptive and regular clustering ensembles using different consensus functions on a number of data sets. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy for some clustering structures.},

OpenCL is an open standard that can be used to program CPUs, GPUs, and other devices from different vendors, while CUDA is specific to NVIDIA GPUs. Although OpenCL promises a portable language for GPU programming, its generality may entail a performance penalty. In this paper, we use complex, near-identical kernels from a Quantum Monte Carlo application to compare the performance of CUDA and OpenCL. We show that when using NVIDIA compiler tools, converting a CUDA kernel to an OpenCL kernel involves minimal modifications. Making such a kernel compile with ATI's build tools involves more modifications. Our performance tests measure and compare data transfer times to and from the GPU, kernel execution times, and end-to-end application execution times for both CUDA and OpenCL.},

It is also 23\% faster, on average, than even a very carefully optimized multicore CPU sorting routine. To achieve this performance, we carefully design our algorithms to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and decompose the computation into independent tasks that perform minimal global communication. We exploit the high-speed onchip shared memory provided by NVIDIA's GPU architecture and efficient data-parallel primitives, particularly parallel scan. While targeted at GPUs, these algorithms should also be well-suited for other manycore processors.},

@article{Strehl2002,
abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We rst identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three e ective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The rst combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively di erent application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: This paper introduces the application of a novel clustering method to microarray expression data. Its first stage involves compression of dimensions that can be achieved by applying SVD to the gene-sample matrix in microarray problems. Thus the data (samples or genes) can be represented by vectors in a truncated space of low dimensionality, 4 and 5 in the examples studied here. We find it preferable to project all vectors onto the unit sphere before applying a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm used here is the quantum clustering method that has one free scale parameter. Although the method is not hierarchical, it can be modified to allow hierarchy in terms of this scale parameter. RESULTS: We apply our method to three data sets. The results are very promising. On cancer cell data we obtain a dendrogram that reflects correct groupings of cells. In an AML/ALL data set we obtain very good clustering of samples into four classes of the data. Finally, in clustering of genes in yeast cell cycle data we obtain four groups in a problem that is estimated to contain five families.

The core of our variant is an effective and explicit contraction of the graph. Our multi-core CPU implementation scales linearly up to 8 threads, whereas the GPU implementation performs considerably better than the optimal number of threads running on the CPU. We also show that our implementations outperform all other parallel MST-solver implementations in (ii), for a broad set of publicly available road- network graphs.},

abstract = {The problem of decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components is a fundamental graph problem inherently present in many scientific and commercial applications. In this paper we show how some of the existing parallel algorithms can be reformulated in order to be accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA technology. In particular, we design a new CUDA-aware procedure for pivot selection and we adapt selected parallel algorithms for CUDA accelerated computation. We also experimentally demonstrate that with a single GTX 480 GPU card we can easily outperform the optimal serial CPU implementation by an order of magnitude in most cases, 40 times on some sufficiently big instances. This is an interesting result as unlike the serial CPU case, the asymptotic complexity of the parallel algorithms is not optimal.},

We make an extensive analysis of the performance gaps taking into account programming models, ptimization strategies, architectural details, and underlying compilers. Our results show that, for most applications, CUDA performs at most 30$\backslash$\&\#x025; better than OpenCL. We also show that this difference is due to unfair comparisons: in fact, OpenCL can achieve similar performance to CUDA under a fair comparison. Therefore, we define a fair comparison of the two types of applications, providing guidelines for more potential analyses. We also investigate OpenCL's portability by running the benchmarks on other prevailing platforms with minor modifications. Overall, we conclude that OpenCL's portability does not fundamentally affect its performance, and OpenCL can be a good alternative to CUDA.},

The adios (automatic distillation of structure) algorithm relies on a statistical method for pattern extraction and on structured generalization, two processes that have been implicated in language acquisition. It has been evaluated on artificial context-free grammars with thousands of rules, on natural languages as diverse as English and Chinese, and on protein data correlating sequence with function.

abstract = {Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become a competitive accelerator for applications outside the graphics domain, mainly driven by the improvements inGPUprogrammability. Although the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a simple C-like interface for programming NVIDIA GPUs, porting applications to CUDA remains a challenge to average programmers. In particular, CUDA places on the programmer the burden of packaging GPU code in separate functions, of explicitly managing data transfer between the host and GPU memories, and of manually optimizing the utilization of the GPU memory. Practical experience shows that the programmer needs to make significant code changes, often tedious and error-prone, before getting an optimized program. We have designed hiCUDA, a high-level directive-based language for CUDA programming. It allows programmers to perform these tedious tasks in a simpler manner and directly to the sequential code, thus speeding up the porting process. In this paper, we describe the hiCUDA directives as well as the design and implementation of a prototype compiler that translates a hiCUDA program to a CUDA program. Our compiler is able to support real-world applications that span multiple procedures and use dynamically allocated arrays. Experiments using nine CUDA benchmarks show that the simplicity hiCUDA provides comes at no expense to performance.},

@article{Dash2002,
abstract = { Processing applications with a large number of dimensions has been a challenge for the KDD community. Feature selection, an effective dimensionality reduction technique, is an essential pre-processing method to remove noisy features. In the literature only a few methods have been proposed for feature selection for clustering, and almost all these methods are 'wrapper' techniques that require a clustering algorithm to evaluate candidate feature subsets. The wrapper approach is largely unsuitable in real-world applications due to its heavy reliance on clustering algorithms that require parameters such as the number of clusters, and the lack of suitable clustering criteria to evaluate clustering in different subspaces. In this paper we propose a 'filter' method that is independent of any clustering algorithm. The proposed method is based on the observation that data with clusters has a very different point-to-point distance histogram to that of data without clusters. By exploiting this we propose an entropy measure that is low if data has distinct clusters and high if it does not. The entropy measure is suitable for selecting the most important subset of features because it is invariant with the number of dimensions, and is affected only by the quality of clustering. Extensive performance evaluation over synthetic, benchmark, and real datasets shows its effectiveness.},

Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with non-trivial diameter. We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum that achieves an asymptotically optimal O(|V|+|E|) work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single and quad-GPU configurations, respectively.

abstract = {Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects into classes of similar objects. Although definitions of similarity vary from one clustering model to another, in most of these models the concept of similarity is based on distances, e.g., Euclidean distance or cosine distance. In other words, similar objects are required to have close values on at least a set of dimensions. In this paper, we explore a more general type of similarity. Under the pCluster model we proposed, two objects are similar if they exhibit a coherent pattern on a subset of dimensions. For instance, in DNA microarray analysis, the expression levels of two genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of environmental stimuli. Although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close, the patterns they exhibit can be very much alike. Discovery of such clusters of genes is essential in revealing significant connections in gene regulatory networks. E-commerce applications, such as collaborative filtering, can also benefit from the new model, which captures not only the closeness of values of certain leading indicators but also the closeness of (purchasing, browsing, etc.) patterns exhibited by the customers. Our paper introduces an effective algorithm to detect such clusters, and we perform tests on several real and synthetic data sets to show its effectiveness.},

The exploding volumes of biological data are craving for extreme computational power and special computing facilities (i.e. super-computers). An inexpensive solution, such as General Purpose computation based on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), can be adapted to tackle this challenge, but the limitation of the device internal memory can pose a new problem of scalability. An efficient data and computational parallelism with partitioning is required to provide a fast and scalable solution to this problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose an efficient parallel formulation of the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) search problem, which is a popular method for classifying objects in several fields of research, such as pattern recognition, machine learning and bioinformatics. Being very simple and straightforward, the performance of the kNN search degrades dramatically for large data sets, since the task is computationally intensive. The proposed approach is not only fast but also scalable to large-scale instances. Based on our approach, we implemented a software tool GPU-FS-kNN (GPU-based Fast and Scalable k-Nearest Neighbour) for CUDA enabled GPUs. The basic approach is simple and adaptable to other available GPU architectures. We observed speed-ups of 50-60 times compared with CPU implementation on a well-known breast microarray study and its associated data sets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our GPU-based Fast and Scalable k-Nearest Neighbour search technique (GPU-FS-kNN) provides a significant performance improvement for nearest neighbour computation in large-scale networks.

@article{Asanovic2006,
abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism. We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following: The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar. Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.) "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs. To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors. To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism. Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters. Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines. To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost. Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems.},

abstract = {Many-core graphics processors are playing today an important role in the advancements of modern highly concurrent processors. Their ability to accelerate computation is being explored under several scientific fields. In the current paper we present the acceleration of a widely used data clustering algorithm, K-means, in the context of high performance GPU clusters. As opposed to most related implementation efforts that use MPI to port their target applications on a GPU cluster, our implementation follows the Software Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM) paradigm in order to distribute information and computation across the accelerator cluster. In order to investigate the efficiency of a programming model that offers shared memory abstraction on GPU clusters we present two implementations, one that is based on a SDSM implementation of OpenMP and another that utilizes the Pleiad cluster middleware on top of the Java platform. The first results show that such an implementation is feasible in order to accelerate a broad category of large scale, data intensive applications, among which K-means is a characteristic case.},

abstract = {Motivation: Feature selection methods aim to reduce the complexity of data and to uncover the most relevant biological variables. In reality, information in biological datasets is often incomplete as a result of untrustworthy samples and missing values. The reliability of selection methods may therefore be questioned.  Method: Information loss is incorporated into a perturbation scheme, testing which features are stable under it. This method is applied to data analysis by unsupervised feature filtering (UFF). The latter has been shown to be a very successful method in analysis of gene-expression data.  Results: We find that the UFF quality degrades smoothly with information loss. It remains successful even under substantial damage. Our method allows for selection of a best imputation method on a dataset treated by UFF. More importantly, scoring features according to their stability under information loss is shown to be correlated with biological importance in cancer studies. This scoring may lead to novel biological insights.

Previous works have illustrated considerable speed gains on computing pair wise Euclidean distances between vectors, which is the fundamental operation in hierarchical clustering. We have used CUDA to implement the complete hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm and show almost double the speed gain using much cheaper desk top graphics card. In this paper we briefly explain the highly parallel and internally distributed programming structure of CUDA. We explore CUDA capabilities and propose methods to efficiently handle data within the graphics hardware for data intense, data independent, iterative or repetitive general purpose algorithms such as the hierarchical clustering.

Meanwhile, Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) has become one of the most effective and highly cited methods to detect and analyze the communities/clusters within an interaction network dataset on many real world problems such us social, technological, or biological networks including protein-protein interaction networks. However, as the dataset become bigger and bigger, the computation time of MCL algorithm become slower and slower. Hence, GPU computing is an interesting and challenging alternative to attempt to improve the MCL performance. In this poster paper we introduce our improvement of MCL performance based on ELLPACK-R sparse dataset format using GPU computing with the Compute Unified Device Architecture tool (CUDA) from NVIDIA (called CUDA-MCL). As the results show the significant improvement in CUDA-MCL performance and with the low-cost and widely available GPU devices in the market today, this CUDA-MCL implementation is allowing large-scale parallel computation on off-the-shelf desktop machines. Moreover the GPU computing approaches potentially may contribute to significantly change the way bioinformaticians and biologists compute and interact with their data.},

abstract = {Diagnostics for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are suboptimal because of limited sensitivity. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to systematically assess the performance characteristics of an oropharyngeal pH probe. In vitro studies compared the oropharyngeal probe with a standard pH catheter in liquid and aerosolized solutions, pH 1-7. The accuracy of measurements, deviation from target pH, and time to equilibrium pH were determined. Simultaneous distal esophageal pH measurements were obtained in 11 patients with GERD. Oropharyngeal and distal esophageal reflux parameters were measured for controls (n = 20), patients with GERD (n = 17), and patients with chronic laryngitis (n = 10). In the liquid phase, at pH 4-5, the oropharyngeal probe had less deviation from the target value than the standard catheter; deviation in the vapor phase was similar (0.4 pH units). Median (interquartile) time to reach equilibrium pH was significantly (P < 0.001) faster with the oropharyngeal than the standard probe. In comparing simultaneous distal esophageal pH characteristics, 96\% of recordings with the new and standard probes were in agreement to within ± 1.0 pH unit; 71\% of recordings were in agreement within ± 0.5 pH units. Patients with chronic laryngitis had significantly higher levels of oropharyngeal acid exposure at pH <4, <5, and <6, in the upright position than patients with GERD or controls (P < .001). Oropharyngeal pH monitoring appears to be more sensitive than traditional pH monitoring in evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux. It is a promising tool in evaluation of this difficult group of patients. \{$\backslash$copyright\} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {How does one search for a needle in a multi-dimensional haystack without knowing what a needle is and without knowing if there is one in the haystack? This kind of problem requires a paradigm shift - away from hypothesis driven searches of the data - towards a methodology that lets the data speak for itself. Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) is such a methodology. DQC is a powerful visual method that works with big, high-dimensional data. It exploits variations of the density of the data (in feature space) and unearths subsets of the data that exhibit correlations among all the measured variables. The outcome of a DQC analysis is a movie that shows how and why sets of data-points are eventually classified as members of simple clusters or as members of - what we call - extended structures. This allows DQC to be successfully used in a non-conventional exploratory mode where one searches data for unexpected information without the need to model the data. We show how this works for big, complex, real-world datasets that come from five distinct fields: i.e., x-ray nano-chemistry, condensed matter, biology, seismology and finance. These studies show how DQC excels at uncovering unexpected, small - but meaningful - subsets of the data that contain important information. We also establish an important new result: namely, that big, complex datasets often contain interesting structures that will be missed by many conventional clustering techniques. Experience shows that these structures appear frequently enough that it is crucial to know they can exist, and that when they do, they encode important hidden information. In short, we not only demonstrate that DQC can be flexibly applied to datasets that present significantly different challenges, we also show how a simple analysis can be used to look for the needle in the haystack, determine what it is, and find what this means.},

In SVC, the minimal sphere, when mapped back to data space, separates into several components, each enclosing a separate cluster of points. A soft margin constant helps in coping with outliers and overlapping clusters. In QC, minima of the potential define cluster centers, and equipotential surfaces are used to construct the clusters. In both methods, the width of the Gaussian kernel controls the scale at which the data are probed for cluster formations. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms on several data sets.},

The use of a shared nearest neighbor de nition of similarity alleviates problems with varying densities and high dimensionality, while the use of core points handles problems with shape and size. While our algorithm can nd the dense" clusters that other clustering algorithms nd, it also nds clusters that these approaches overlook, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent relatively uniform regions surrounded" by non-uniform or higher density areas. We experimentally show that our algorithm performs better than traditional methods (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, CURE) on a variety of data sets: KDD Cup `99 network intrusion data, NASA Earth science time series data, and two-dimensional point sets. The run-time complexity of our technique is O(n2) if the similarity matrix has to be constructed. However, we discuss a number of optimizations that allow the algorithm to handle large data sets efficiently.},

Many theoretical improvements for the performance of original algorithms have been put forward, while almost all of them are based on single instruction single data (SISD) architecture processors (GPUs), which partly ignored the inherent paralleled characteristic of the algorithms. In this paper, a novel single instruction multiple data (SIMD) architecture processors (GPUs) based k-means algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, in order to accelerate compute-intensive portions of traditional k-means, both data objects assignment and k-centroids recalculation are offloaded to the GPU in parallel. We have implemented this GPU-based k-means on the newest generation GPU with compute unified device architecture(CUDA). The numerical experiments demonstrated that the speed of GPU-based k-means could reach as high as 40 times of the CPU-based k-means.},

abstract = {The uninterrupted growth of information repositories has progressively lead data-intensive applications, such as MapReduce-based systems, to the mainstream. The MapReduce paradigm has frequently proven to be a simple yet flexible and scalable technique to distribute algorithms across thousands of nodes and petabytes of information. Under these circumstances, classic data mining algorithms have been adapted to this model, in order to run in production environments. Unfortunately, the high latency nature of this architecture has relegated the applicability of these algorithms to batch-processing scenarios. In spite of this shortcoming, the emergence of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU), on the commodity computing market has enabled these algorithms to be executed orders of magnitude faster, while keeping the same MapReduce based model. In this paper, we propose the integration of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors into MapReduce-based clusters creating a unified heterogeneous architecture that enables executing Map and Reduce operators on thousands of threads across multiple GPU devices and nodes, while maintaining the built-in reliability of the baseline system. For this purpose, we created a programming model that facilitates the collaboration of multiple CPU cores and multiple GPU devices towards the resolution of a data intensive problem. In order to prove the potential of this hybrid system, we take a popular NP-Hard supervised learning algorithm, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and show that a 36x \&\#x2013; 192x speedup can be achieved on large datasets without changing the model or leaving the commodity hardware paradigm.},

abstract = {We present a novel external sorting algorithm using graphics processors (GPUs) on large databases composed of billions of records and wide keys. Our algorithm uses the data parallelism within a GPU along with task parallelism by scheduling some of the memory-intensive and compute-intensive threads on the GPU. Our new sorting architecture provides multiple memory interfaces on the same PC -- a fast and dedicated memory interface on the GPU along with the main memory interface for CPU computations. As a result, we achieve higher memory bandwidth as compared to CPU-based algorithms running on commodity PCs. Our approach takes into account the limited communication bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU, and reduces the data communication between the two processors. Our algorithm also improves the performance of disk transfers and achieves close to peak I/O performance. We have tested the performance of our algorithm on the SortBenchmark and applied it to large databases composed of a few hundred Gigabytes of data. Our results on a 3 GHz Pentium IV PC with \$300 NVIDIA 7800 GT GPU indicate a significant performance improvement over optimized CPU-based algorithms on high-end PCs with 3.6 GHz Dual Xeon processors. Our implementation is able to outperform the current high-end PennySort benchmark and results in a higher performance to price ratio. Overall, our results indicate that using a GPU as a co-processor can significantly improve the performance of sorting algorithms on large databases.},

The stochas- tic motion and collision of quantum particles give rise to a stochastic process of quantum entanglement of particles. The stationary probability distribution over the configuration space of entangled particles results in the optimally clustering solution of the given data set. The quantum particle model has advantages in terms of the insensitivity to noise, the quality robustness to clustered data, the learning ability, and the suitability for high-dimensional multi-shape large-scale data sets. In comparison with the classical version of particle model and the cellular automata, the quantum particle mode has much faster speed and higher quality for clustering.

The proposed detection system is based on elliptical blobs and principal component analysis (PCA). The elliptical blobs in the directional image are used to find the face candidate regions, and then PCA and QEA are employed to verify faces. Although PCA related algorithms have shown outstanding performance, there still exist some problems such as optimal decision boundary or learning capabilities. By PCA, we can obtain the optimal basis but they may not be the optimal ones for discriminating faces from non-faces. Moreover, a threshold value should be selected properly considering the success rate and false alarm rate. To solve these problems, QEA is employed to find out the optimal decision boundary under the predetermined threshold value which distinguishes between face images and non-face images. The proposed system provides learning capability by reconstructing the training database, which means that system performance can be improved as failure trials occur.},

In this work, we present a GPU-optimized implementation for finding the connected components of a given graph. Our implementation tries to minimize the impact of irregularity, both at the data level and functional level. Our implementation achieves a speed up of 9 to 12 times over the best sequential CPU implementation. For instance, our implementation finds connected components of a graph of 10 million nodes and 60 million edges in about 500 milliseconds on a GPU, given a random edge list. We also draw interesting observations on why PRAM algorithms, such as the Shiloach-Vishkin algorithm may not be a good fit for the GPU and how they should be modified.},

abstract = {Modern General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) provide high degrees of parallelism in computation and memory access, making them suitable for data parallel applications such as those using the elastic MapReduce model. Yet designing a MapReduce framework for GPUs faces significant challenges brought by their multi-level memory hierarchy. Due to the absence of atomic operations in the earlier generations of GPUs, existing GPU MapReduce frameworks have problems in handling input/output data with varied or unpredictable sizes. Also, existing frameworks utilize mostly a single level of memory, $\backslash$emph\{i.e.\}, the relatively spacious yet slow global memory. In this work, we attempt to explore the potential benefit of enabling a GPU MapReduce framework to use multiple levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. We propose a novel GPU data staging scheme for MapReduce workloads, tailored toward the GPU memory hierarchy. Centering around the efficient utilization of the fast but very small shared memory, we designed and implemented a GPU MapReduce framework, whose key techniques include (1) shared memory staging area management, (2) thread-role partitioning, and (3) intra-block thread synchronization. We carried out evaluation with five popular MapReduce workloads and studied their performance under different GPU memory usage choices. Our results reveal that exploiting GPU shared memory is highly promising for the Map phase (with an average 2.85x speedup over using global memory only), while in the Reduce phase the benefit of using shared memory is much less pronounced, due to the high input-to-output ratio. In addition, when compared to Mars, an existing GPU MapReduce framework, our system is shown to bring a significant speedup in Map/Reduce phases.},

abstract = {We studied a number of measures that charaterize the difficulty of a classification problem, focusing on the geometrical complexity of the class boudary. We compared a set of real world problems to random labelings of points and found that real problems contain structures in this measurement space that are significantly different from the random sets. Distributions of problems in this space show that there exist at least two independent factors affecting a problem's difficulty. We suggest using this space to describe a classifier's domain of competence. This can guide static and dynamic selection of classifiers fro specific problems as well as subproblems formed by confinement, projection, and transformations of the feature vectors.},

The resulting platform-agnostic, single source application is benchmarked on a number of different architectures, and is shown to be 1.3-1.5× slower than native FORTRAN 77 or CUDA implementations on a single node and 1.3-3.1× slower on multiple nodes.

As the first attempt to harness GPU’s power for MapReduce, we developed Mars on an NVIDIA G80 GPU, which contains over one hundred processors, and evaluated it in comparison with Phoenix, the state-of-the-art MapReduce framework on multi-core CPUs. Mars hides the programming complexity of the GPU behind the simple and familiar MapReduce interface. It is up to 16 times faster than its CPU-based counterpart for six common web applications on a quad-core machine. Categories},

abstract = {Accelerators and heterogeneous architectures in general, andGPUs in particular, have recently emerged asmajor players in high perfor- mance computing. For many classes of applications, MapReduce has emerged as the framework for easing parallel programming and improving programmer productivity. There have already been sev- eral efforts on implementingMapReduce on GPUs. In this paper, we propose a new implementation of MapReduce for GPUs, which is very effective in utilizing shared memory, a small programmable cache on modern GPUs. The main idea is to use a reduction-based method to execute aMapReduce applica- tion. The reduction-based method allows us to carry out reductions in shared memory. To support a general and efficient implemen- tation, we support the following features: a memory hierarchy for maintaining the reduction object, a multi-group scheme in shared memory to trade-off space requirements and locking overheads, a general and efficient data structure for the reduction object, and an efficient swapping mechanism. We have evaluated our framework with seven commonly used MapReduce applications and compared it with the sequential im- plementations, MapCG, a recent MapReduce implementation on GPUs, and Ji et al.’s work, a recent MapReduce implementation that utilizes shared memory in a different way. The main observa- tions from our experimental results are as follows. For four of the seven applications that can be considered as reduction-intensive ap- plications, our framework has a speedup of between 5 and 200 over MapCG (for large datasets). Similarly, we achieved a speedup of between 2 and 60 over Ji et al.’s work.},

(b) Should the same similarity measure be used throughout the d-dimensional feature space? In other words, are the underlying clusters in given data of similar shape? Our goal is to learn the pairwise similarity between points in order to facilitate a proper partitioning of the data without the a priori knowledge of k, the number of clusters, and of the shape of these clusters. We explore a clustering ensemble approach combined with cluster stability criteria to selectively learn the similarity from a collection of different clustering algorithms with various parameter configurations},

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances.

abstract = {Document clustering plays an important role in data mining systems. Recently, a flocking-based document clustering algorithm has been proposed to solve the problem through simulation resembling the flocking behavior of birds in nature. This method is superior to other clustering algorithms, including k-means, in the sense that the outcome is not sensitive to the initial state. One limitation of this approach is that the algorithmic complexity is inherently quadratic in the number of documents. As a result, execution time becomes a bottleneck with large number of documents. In this paper, we assess the benefits of exploiting the computational power of Beowulf-like clusters equipped with contemporary Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as a means to significantly reduce the runtime of flocking-based document clustering. Our framework scales up to over one million documents processed simultaneously in a sixteen-node moderate GPU cluster. Results are also compared to a four-node cluster with higher-end GPUs. On these clusters, we observe 30X-50X speedups, which demonstrate the potential of GPU clusters to efficiently solve massive data mining problems. Such speedups combined with the scalability potential and accelerator-based parallelization are unique in the domain of document-based data mining, to the best of our knowledge.},

It is quite simple to program a graphics processor to perform general parallel tasks. But after understanding the various architectural aspects of the graphics processor, it can be used to perform other taxing tasks as well. In this paper, we will show how CUDA can fully utilize the tremendous power of these GPUs. CUDA is NVIDIA’s parallel computing architecture. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance, by harnessing the power of the GPU. This paper talks about CUDA and its architecture. It takes us through a comparison of CUDA C/C++ with other parallel programming languages like OpenCL and DirectCompute.

Most of the previous attempts for improving the speed of MST using parallel computing are too complicated to implement or perform well only on special graphs with regular structure. In this paper we design and implement four parallel MST algorithms (three variations of Bor??vka plus our new approach) for arbitrary sparse graphs that for the first time give speedup when compared with the best sequential algorithm. In fact, our algorithms also solve the minimum spanning forest problem. We provide an experimental study of our algorithms on symmetric multiprocessors such as IBMs pSeries and Sun's Enterprise servers. Our new implementation achieves good speedups over a wide range of input graphs with regular and irregular structures, including the graphs used by previous parallel MST studies. For example, on an arbitrary random graph with 1 M vertices and 20 M edges, our new approach achieves a speedup of 5 using 8 processors.

abstract = {One of the most widely used clustering techniques used in GISc problems is the k-means algorithm. One of the most important issues in the correct use of k-means is the initialization procedure that ultimately determines which part of the solution space will be searched. In this paper we briefly review different initialization procedures, and propose Kohonens Self- Organizing Maps as the most convenient method, given the proper training parameters. Furthermore, we show that in the final stages of its training procedure the Self-Organizing Map algorithms is rigorously the same as the kmeans algorithm. Thus we propose the use of Self-Organizing Maps as possible substitutes for the more classical k-means clustering algorithms.},

abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model from Google that facilitates parallel processing on a cluster of thousands of commodity computers. The success of MapReduce in cluster environments has motivated several studies of implementing MapReduce on a graphics processing unit (GPU), but generally focusing on the NVIDIA GPU. Our investigation reveals that the design and mapping of the MapReduce framework needs to be revisited for AMD GPUs due to their notable architectural differences from NVIDIA GPUs. For instance, current state-of-the-art MapReduce implementations employ atomic operations to coordinate the execution of different threads. However, atomic operations can implicitly cause inefficient memory access, and in turn, severely impact performance. In this paper, we propose Streamer, an OpenCL MapReduce framework optimized for AMD GPUs. With efficient atomic-free algorithms for output handling and intermediate result shuffling, Stream MR is superior to atomic-based MapReduce designs and can outperform existing atomic-free MapReduce implementations by nearly five-fold on an AMD Radeon HD 5870.},

abstract = {Based on the concepts and principles of quantum computing, a novel clustering algorithm, called a quantum-inspired immune clonal clustering algorithm based on watershed (QICW), is proposed to deal with the problem of image segmentation. In QICW, antibody is proliferated and divided into a set of subpopulation groups. Antibodies in a subpopulation group are represented by multi-state gene quantum bits. In the antibody's updating, the quantum mutation operator is applied to accelerate convergence. The quantum recombination realizes the information communication between the subpopulation groups so as to avoid premature convergences. In this paper, the segmentation problem is viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem, the original image is partitioned into small blocks by watershed algorithm, and the quantum-inspired immune clonal algorithm is used to search the optimal clustering centre, and make the sequence of maximum affinity function as clustering result, and finally obtain the segmentation result. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for texture image and SAR image segmentation, compared with the genetic clustering algorithm based on watershed (W-GAC), and the k-means algorithm based on watershed (W-KM).},

@article{Walter2008,
abstract = {Hierarchical representations of large data sets, such as binary cluster trees, are a crucial component in many scalable algorithms used in various fields. Two major approaches for building these trees are agglomerative, or bottom-up, clustering and divisive, or top-down, clustering. The agglomerative approach offers some real advantages such as more flexible clustering and often produces higher quality trees, but has been little used in graphics because it is frequently assumed to be prohibitively expensive (O(N<sup>2</sup>) or worse). In this paper we show that agglomerative clustering can be done efficiently even for very large data sets. We introduce a novel locally-ordered algorithm that is faster than traditional heap-based agglomerative clustering and show that the complexity of the tree build time is much closer to linear than quadratic. We also evaluate the quality of the agglomerative clustering trees compared to the best known divisive clustering strategies in two sample applications: bounding volume hierarchies for ray tracing and light trees in the Lightcuts rendering algorithm. Tree quality is highly application, data set, and dissimilarity function specific. In our experiments the agglomerative-built tree quality is consistently higher by margins ranging from slight to significant, with up to 35\% reduction in tree query times.},

abstract = {K-Means is the clustering algorithm which is widely used in many areas such as information retrieval, computer vision and pattern recognition. With the recent advance in General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU), we can use a modern GPU which is capable to do computation up to Tflops to calculate K-Means clustering on average problems. However, due to the exponential growth of data, the K-Means clustering on a single GPU will not be adequate for large datasets in the near future. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an efficient large-scale parallel K-Means on GPU clusters. We utilize the massive parallelism in GPUs to speed up the most time consuming part of K-Means clustering in each node. We employ the dynamic load balancing to distribute workload equally on different GPUs installed in the clusters so as to improve the performance of the parallel K-Means at the inter-node level. We also take advantage from software distributed shared memory to simplify the communication and collaboration among nodes. The result of the evaluation shows the performance improvement of the parallel K-Means by maintaining load balance on GPU clusters.},

We implement the traditional HAC and the Partially Overlapping Partitioning (PoP) on GPU using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and compare the computational performance with CPU using micro array data. The result shows that the PoP HAC and traditional HAC are up to 442 times and 66 times faster on the GPU respectively than the time taken by CPU. The PoP-enabled HAC on GPU requires only a fraction of the memory required by traditional HAC both on the CPU and GPU.},

abstract = {The number of clusters has to be known in advance for the conventional k-means clustering algorithm and moreover the clustering result is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centroids. This sensitivity may make the algorithm converge to the local optima. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm for k-means clustering (KMQGA). In KMQGA, a Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as the typical genetic algorithm operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bits. Different from the typical quantum-inspired genetic algorithms (QGA), the length of a Q-bit in KMQGA is variable during evolution. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, KMQGA can obtain the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids. Both the simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA, respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and effective. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines some alternative ways to represent text based on syntactic and semantic relationships between words (phrases, synonyms and hypernyms). We describe the new representations and try to justify our suspicions that they could have improved the performance of a rule-based learner. The representations are evaluated using the RIPPER rule-based learner on the Reuters-21578 and DigiTrad test corpora, but on their own the new representations are not found to produce a significant performance improvement. Finally, we try combining classifiers based on different representations using a majority voting technique. This step does produce some performance improvement on both test collections. In general, our work supports the emerging consensus in the information retrieval community that more sophisticated Natural Language Processing techniques need to be developed before better text representations can be produced. We conclude that for now, research into new learning algorithms and methods for combining existing learners holds the most promise.},

Due to GPU's tremendous computing capability, it has emerged as the co-processor of the CPU to achieve a high overall throughput. CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we present a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN, CUKNN, using CUDA multi-thread model. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of the GPU. CUKNN outperforms significantly and achieve up to 15.2X speedup. It also shows good scalability when varying the dimension of the training dataset and the number of records in training dataset.},

While many published works have shown that GPUs can be used to accelerate various general purpose applications with respectable performance gains, few attempts have been made to tackle very large problems. Our goal here is to investigate if GPUs can be useful accelerators even with very large data sets that cannot fit into GPU’s onboard memory. Using a popular clustering algorithm, K-Means, as an example, our results have been very positive. On a data set with a billion data points, our GPU-accelerated implementation achieved an order of magnitude performance gain over a highly optimized CPU-only version running on 8 cores, and more than two orders of magnitude gain over a popular benchmark, MineBench, running on a single core.},

Herein, we demonstrate that the outcome of lethal/sublethal influenza infection instead correlates with the initial virus replication tempo. Furthermore, the magnitude of early lung antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies inversely with inoculum dose and is controlled by lymph-node-resident dendritic cells (LNDC) through IL-12p40-regulated FasL-dependent T cell apoptosis. These results suggest that the inoculum dose and replication rate of a pathogen entering the respiratory tract may regulate the strength of the adaptive immune response, and the subsequent outcome of infection and that LNDC may serve as regulators (gatekeepers) in the development of CD8+ T cell responses.},

K-means has a sequential data dependence wherein iterations occur in a linear fashion, while the hierarchical clustering has a tree-like dependence that produces split tasks.

abstract = {Given a data set, a dynamical procedure is applied to the data points in order to shrink and separate, possibly overlapping clusters. Namely, Newton's equations of motion are employed to concentrate the data points around their cluster centers, using an attractive potential, constructed specially for this purpose. During this process, important information is gathered concerning the spread of each cluster. In succession this information is used to create an objective function that maps each cluster to a local maximum. Global optimization is then used to retrieve the positions of the maxima that correspond to the locations of the cluster centers. Further refinement is achieved by applying the EM-algorithm to a Gaussian mixture model whose construction and initialization is based on the acquired information. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted experiments on a plethora of benchmark data sets. In addition we have compared its performance against four clustering techniques that are well established in the literature. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the method only uses matrix operations, which readily lend themselves to parallelization. In this paper, we develop an implementation on graphics hardware and investigate how this approach can accelerate the computations.

This allows for analytic evaluation of the time evolution of all such states opening up the possibility of exploration of relationships among data points through observation of varying dynamical distances among points and convergence of points into clusters.

To enhance the performance of computing systems, researchers and developers use the parallel computing architecture of GPU.

The benefit of involving the two programming models in GPU is that researchers and developers don't have to understand OpenGL, DirectX or other program design, but can use GPU through simple programming language. OpenCL is an open standard API, which has the advantage of cross-platform. CUDA is a parallel computer architecture developed by NVIDIA, which includes Runtime API and Driver API. Compared with OpenCL, CUDA is with better performance. In this paper, we used plenty of similar kernels to compare the computing performance of C, OpenCL and CUDA, the two kinds of API's on NVIDIA Quadro 4000 GPU. The experimental result showed that, the executive time of CUDA Driver API was 94.9\%\~{}99.0\% faster than that of C, while and the executive time of CUDA Driver API was 3.8\%\~{}5.4\% faster than that of OpenCL.

abstract = {Graphics processors (GPUs) provide a vast number of simple, data-parallel, deeply multithreaded cores and high memory bandwidths. GPU architectures are becoming increasingly programmable, offering the potential for dramatic speedups for a variety of general-purpose applications compared to contemporary general-purpose processors (CPUs). This paper uses NVIDIA's C-like CUDA language and an engineering sample of their recently introduced GTX 260 GPU to explore the effectiveness of GPUs for a variety of application types, and describes some specific coding idioms that improve their performance on the GPU. GPU performance is compared to both single-core and multicore CPU performance, with multicore CPU implementations written using OpenMP. The paper also discusses advantages and inefficiencies of the CUDA programming model and some desirable features that might allow for greater ease of use and also more readily support a larger body of applications. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, in most feature-oriented methods, the construction of feature models heavily depends on the domain analysts' personal understanding, and the work of constructing feature models from the original requirements of sample applications is often tedious and ineffective. This paper proposes a semiautomatic approach to constructing feature models based on requirements clustering, which automates the activities of feature identification, organization and variability modeling to a great extent. The underlying idea of this approach is to analyze the relationships between individual requirements and cluster tight-related requirements into features. With the automatic support of this approach, good quality feature models can be constructed in a more effective way. A case study is also provided to show the feasibility of this approach.},

@article{Wu2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we report our research on using GPUs as accelerators for Business Intelligence(BI) analytics. We are particularly interested in analytics on very large data sets, which are common in today's real world BI applications. While many published works have shown that GPUs can be used to accelerate various general purpose applications with respectable performance gains, few attempts have been made to tackle very large problems. Our goal here is to investigate if the GPUs can be useful accelerators for BI analytics with very large data sets that cannot fit into GPUs onboard memory. Using a popular clustering algorithm, K-Means, as an example, our results have been very positive. For data sets smaller than GPU's onboard memory, the GPU-accelerated version is 6-12x faster than our highly optimized CPU-only version running on an 8-core workstation, or 200-400x faster than the popular benchmark program, MineBench, running on a single core. This is also 2-4x faster than the best reported work. For large data sets which cannot fit in GPU's memory, we further show that with a design which allows the computation on both CPU and GPU, as well as data transfers between them, to proceed in parallel, the GPU-accelerated version can still offer a dramatic performance boost. For example, for a data set with 100 million 2-d data points and 2,000 clusters, the GPU-accelerated version took about 6 minutes, while the CPU-only version running on an 8-core workstation took about 58 minutes. Compared to other approaches, GPU-accelerated implementations of analytics potentially provide better raw performance, better cost-performance ratios, and better energy performance ratios.},

abstract = {Abstract - Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have recently been the subject of attention in re- search as an efficient coprocessor for implementing many classes of highly parallel applications. The GPUs design is engineered for graphics applications, where many independent SIMD workloads are simultaneously dispatched to processing elements. While parallelism has been explored in the context of traditional CPU threads and SIMD processing elements, the principles involved in dividing the steps of a parallel algorithm for execution on GPU architectures remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a first step towards building an efficient GPU-based parallel implemen- tation of a commonly used clustering algorithm called K-Means on an NVIDIA G80 PCI express graphics board using the CUDA processing extensions. Clustering algorithms are important for search, data mining, spam and intrusion detection applications. Modern desktop machines commonly include desktop search software that can be greatly enhanced by these advances, while low-power ma- chines such as laptops can reduce power consump- tion by utilizing the video chip for these clustering and indexing operations. Our preliminary results show over a 13x performance improvement com- pared to a baseline 3 GHz Intel Pentium(R) based PC running the same algorithm with an average spec G80 graphics card, the NVIDIA 8600GT. The low cost of these video cards (less than \$100 market price as of 2008), and the high performance gains suggest that our approach is both practical and economical for common applications.},

(b) Should the same similarity measure be used throughout the d-dimensional feature space? In other words, are the underlying clusters in given data of similar shape? Our goal is to learn the pairwise similarity between points in order to facilitate a proper partitioning of the data without the a priori knowledge of k, the number of clusters, and of the shape of these clusters. We explore a clustering ensemble approach combined with cluster stability criteria to selectively learn the similarity from a collection of different clustering algorithms with various parameter configurations},

The computational complexity and sheer scale of these simulations have lead to the exploration of the application of high-performance hybrid computing clusters to accelerate the design process. Currently, the hybrid clusters in use are composed primarily of commodity workstations and servers incorporating commodity NVIDIA-based GPU graphics cards and TESLA GPU computational accelerators. We have also been experimenting with blade clusters composed of both general purpose servers and PowerXcell accelerators leveraging the computational throughput of the Cell processor. In this paper we will detail our experiences with accelerating our workloads on these hybrid cluster platforms.

For calibrating the QXQGA, the quantum crossover and mutation operators are evaluated using relative percentage deviation for selecting the best combination.

abstract = {In a world that is continuously providing enormous amounts of data (be it from satellite teledetection, industrial/biological sensors or historical data for ﬁnancial use, among many other sources), the need to quickly search through it and discover its interesting trends is becoming more and more important. Indexing is the process that allows to extract the interesting bits of information out of these oceans of data in a very short time, thus making possible the analysis of huge amounts of data. PyTables is a hierarchically-organized database that is focused on dealing with such large data scenarios. In PyTables 1.x series, indexing was implemented using a simple approach, so-called PSI, that worked ﬁne for medium sized tables, but that was not very efﬁcient for dealing with large ones. With the advent of PyTables 2.0 Pro, we are introducing OPSI, a completely new implementation of the indexing engine that signiﬁcantly improves look-up times for all sizes of tables, and most specially for very large ones (> 100 millions of rows). In addition, the new implementation provides an innovative feature that lets the user create indexes having a certain level of quality, allowing her to select the one that is best suited to her particular needs. This article describes the implementation of this new indexing system, while showing experimental ﬁgures about its performance.},

Nvidia Corporation released a new generation of GPUs designed for general-purpose computing in 2006, and it released a GPU programming language called CUDA in 2007. The DNA microarray technology is a high throughput tool for assaying mRNA abundance in cell samples. In data analysis, scientists often apply hierarchical clustering of the genes, where a fundamental operation is to calculate all pairwise distances. If there are n genes, it takes O(n\^{}2) time. In this work, GPUs and the CUDA language are used to calculate pairwise distances. For Manhattan distance, GPU/CUDA achieves a 40 to 90 times speed-up compared to the central processing unit implementation; for Pearson correlation coefficient, the speed-up is 28 to 38 times.},

We show new exponential quantum speedups which may be obtained over classical algorithms in this oracle model. Even stronger, we describe several problems which are impossible to solve classically but can be solved by a quantum algorithm using a single query; we show that such infinity-vs-one separations between classical and quantum query complexities can be constructed from any separation between classical and quantum query complexities (in the unbounded-error regime). We also give conditions to determine when oracle problems---either in the standard model, or in any of the generalizations we consider---cannot be solved with success probability better than random guessing would achieve. In the oracle model with internal randomness where the goal is to gain any nonzero advantage over guessing, we prove (roughly speaking) that (k) quantum queries are equivalent in power to (2k) classical queries, thus extending results of Meyer and Pommersheim, and Montanaro, Nishimura and Raymond.},

The resulting sparse feature sets were trained by logistic regression (using LIBLINEAR).

Initial development was conducted on an internal split of training data for training and validation. We identified some useful feature combinations to improve the performance. For the final submission, we combined results of student sub- teams by regularized linear regression.

abstract = {Sorting is a well-investigated topic in Computer Science in general and by now many efficient sorting algorithms for CPUs and GPUs have been developed. There is no swapping, paging, etc. available on GPUs to provide more virtual memory than physically available, thus if one wants to sort sequences that exceed GPU memory using the GPU the problem of external sorting arises. In this contribution we present a novel merge-based external sorting algorithm for one or more CUDA-enabled GPUs. We reduce the performance impact of memory transfers to and from the GPU by using an approach similar to regular samplesort and by overlapping memory transfers with GPU computation. We achieve a good utilization of GPUs and load balancing among them by carefully choosing the samples and the amount of GPU memory used for computation. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by extended testing. Using two GTX280 the implementation outperforms the fastest CPU sorting algorithms known to the authors.},

abstract = {Big data processing is receiving significant amount of interest as an important technology to reveal the information behind the data, such as trends, characteristics, etc. MapReduce is one of the most popular distributed parallel data processing framework. However, some high-end applications, especially some scientific analyses have both data-intensive and computation intensive features. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a high performance big data process framework called Lit, which leverages the power of Hadoop and GPUs. In this paper, we presented the basic design and architecture of Lit. More importantly, we spent a lot of effort on optimizing the communications between CPU and GPU. Lit integrated GPU with Hadoop to improve the computational power of each node in the cluster. To simplify the parallel programming, Lit provided an annotation based approach to automatically generate CUDA codes from Hadoop codes. Lit hid the complexity of programming on CPU/GPU cluster by providing extended compiler and optimizer. To utilize the simplified programming, scalability and fault tolerance benefits of Hadoop and combine them with the high performance computation power of GPU, Lit extended the Hadoop by applying a GPUClassloader to detect the GPU, generate and compile CUDA codes, and invoke the shared library. For all CPU-GPU co-processing systems, the communication with the GPU is the well-known performance bottleneck. We introduced data flow optimization approach to reduce unnecessary memory copies. Our experimental results show that Lit can achieve an average speedup of 1x to 3x on three typical applications over Hadoop, and the data flow optimization approach for the Lit can achieve about 16\% performance gain. © 2013 IEEE.},

Elimination of redundant data and duplicates can serve as a viable means for data reduction and it can also aid in sampling. Visual feedback is very valuable here to give users confidence in this process. Furthermore, big data preprocessing is seldom interactive, which stands at conflict with users who seek answers immediately. The best one can do is incremental preprocessing in which partial and hopefully quite accurate results become available relatively quickly and are then refined over time. We propose a correlation clustering framework which uses MDS for layout and GPU-acceleration to accomplish these goals. Our domain application is the correlation clustering of atmospheric mass spectrum data with 8 million data points of 450 dimensions each. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The ability to cluster data accurately is essential to applications such as image segmentation. Therefore, techniques that enhance accuracy are of keen interest. One such technique involves applying a quantum mechanical system model, such as that of the quantum bit, to generate probabilistic numerical output to be used as variable input for clustering algorithms. This work demonstrates that applying a quantum bit model to data clustering algorithms can increase clustering accuracy, as a result of simulating superposition as well as possessing both guaranteed and controllable convergence properties. For accuracy assessment purposes, four quantum-modeled clustering algorithms for multi-band image segmentation are explored and evaluated. The clustering algorithms of choice consist of quantum variants of K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, New Weighted Fuzzy C- Means, and the Artificial Bee Colony. Data sets of interest include multi-band imagery, which subsequent to classification are analyzed and assessed for accuracy. Results demonstrate that these algorithms exhibit improved accuracy, when compared to classical counterparts. Moreover, solutions are enhanced via introduction of the quantum state machine, which provides random initial centroid and variable input values to the various clustering algorithms, and quantum operators, which bring about convergence and maximize local search space exploration. Typically, the algorithms have shown to produce better solutions. Keywords:},

abstract = {Clustering methods in machine learning may benefit from borrowing metaphors from physics. Dynamic quantum clustering associates a Gaussian wave packet with the multidimensional data points and regards them as eigenfunctions of the Schr??dinger equation. The clustering structure emerges by letting the system evolve and the visual nature of the algorithm has been shown to be useful in a range of applications. Furthermore, the method only uses matrix operations, which readily lend themselves to parallelization. In this paper, we develop an implementation on graphics hardware and investigate how this approach can accelerate the computations. We achieve a speedup of up to two magnitudes over a multicore CPU implementation, which proves that quantum-like methods and acceleration by graphics processing units have a great relevance to machine learning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Ji2013,
abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role as standardizable cosmological candles, though the nature of their progenitors is a subject of active investigation. Recent observational and theoretical work has pointed to merging white dwarf binaries, referred to as the double-degenerate channel, as the possible progenitor systems for some SNe Ia. Additionally, recent theoretical work suggests that mergers which fail to detonate may produce magnetized, rapidly-rotating white dwarfs. In this paper, we present the first multidimensional simulations of the post-merger evolution of white dwarf binaries to include the effect of the magnetic field. In these systems, the two white dwarfs complete a final merger on a dynamical timescale, and are tidally disrupted, producing a rapidly-rotating white dwarf merger surrounded by a hot corona and a thick, differentially-rotating disk. The disk is strongly susceptible to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and we demonstrate that this leads to the rapid growth of an initially dynamically weak magnetic field in the disk, the spin-down of the white dwarf merger, and to the subsequent central ignition of the white dwarf merger. Additionally, these magnetized models exhibit new features not present in prior hydrodynamic studies of white dwarf mergers, including the development of MRI turbulence in the hot disk, magnetized outflows carrying a significant fraction of the disk mass, and the magnetization of the white dwarf merger to field strengths \$\backslash sim 2 \backslash times 10\^{}8\$ G. We discuss the impact of our findings on the origin and observed properties of SNe Ia and magnetized white dwarfs.},

@article{Vacaliuc2011,
abstract = {Design of data structures for high performance computing (HPC) is one of the principal challenges facing researchers looking to utilize heterogeneous computing machinery. Heterogeneous systems derive cost, power, and speed efficiency by being composed of the appropriate hardware for the task. Yet, each type of processor requires a specific organization of the application state in order to achieve peak performance. Discovering this and refactoring the code can be a challenging and time-consuming task for the researcher, as the data structures and the computational model must be co-designed. We present a methodology that uses Python as the environment for which to explore tradeoffs in both the data structure design as well as the code executing on the computation accelerator. Our method enables multi-dimensional arrays to be used effectively in any target environment. We have chosen to focus on OpenMP and CUDA environments, thus exploring the development of optimized kernels for the two most common classes of computing hardware available today: multi-core CPU and GPU. Python's large palette of file and network access routines, its associative indexing syntax and support for common HPC environments makes it relevant for diverse hardware ranging from laptops through computing clusters to the highest performance supercomputers. Our work enables researchers to accelerate the development of their codes on the computing hardware of their choice.},

@article{McColl2013,
abstract = {Social networks, communication networks, busi- ness intelligence databases, and large scientific data sources now contain hundreds of millions elements with billions of relationships. The relationships in these massive datasets are changing at ever-faster rates. Through representing these datasets as dynamic and semantic graphs of vertices and edges, it is possible to characterize the structure of the relationships and to quickly respond to queries about how the elements in the set are connected. Statically computing analytics on snapshots of these dynamic graphs is frequently not fast enough to provide current and accurate information as the graph changes. This has led to the development of dynamic graph algorithms that can maintain analytic information without resorting to full static recomputation. In this work we present a novel parallel algorithm for tracking the connected components of a dynamic graph. Our approach has a low memory requirement of O(V ) and is appropriate for all graph densities. On a graph with 512 million edges, we show that our new dynamic algorithm is up to 128X faster than well-known static algorithms and that our algorithm achieves a 14X parallel speedup on a x86 64-core shared-memory system. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first parallel implementation of dynamic connected components that does not eventually require static recomputation.},

@article{Grossman2013,
abstract = {As the scale of high performance computing systems grows, three main challenges arise: the programmability, reliability, and energy efficiency of those systems. Accomplishing all three without sacrificing performance requires a rethinking of legacy distributed programming models and homogeneous clusters. In this work, we integrate Hadoop MapReduce with OpenCL to enable the use of heterogeneous processors in a distributed system. We do this by exploiting the implicit data- parallelism of mappers and reducers in a MapReduce system. Combining Hadoop and OpenCL provides 1) an easy-to-learn and flexible application programming interface in a high level and popular programming language, 2) the reliability guarantees and distributed filesystem of Hadoop, and 3) the low power consumption and performance acceleration of heterogeneous processors. This paper presents HadoopCL: an extension to Hadoop which supports execution of user-written Java kernels on heterogeneous devices, optimizes communication through asynchronous transfers and dedicated I/O threads, automatically generates OpenCL kernels from Java bytecode using the open source tool APARAPI, and achieves nearly 3x overall speedup and better than 55x speedup of the computational sections for example MapReduce applications, relative to Hadoop.},

We compared a set of real-world problems to random labelings of points and found that real problems contain structures in this measurement space that are significantly different from the random sets. Distributions of problems in this space show that there exist at least two independent factors affecting a problem's difficulty. We suggest using this space to describe a classifier's domain of competence. This can guide static and dynamic selection of classifiers for specific problems as well as subproblems formed by confinement, projection, and transformations of the feature vectors.},
