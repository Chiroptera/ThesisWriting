# Production

 - took away multiple citations for the same article (authors published the same thing in different journals/conf)
 - book away citation to Bai2009 (2 citations for GPU K-Means is enough?)

# Recovery
 - removed "The proximity measure between clusters in the second step distinguishes between the different HAC linkage algorithms, such as Single-Link , Average-Link, Complete-Link, among others."

## Kruskal's algorithm

 - trimmed a phrase down "(taken directly from the original paper of Kruskal's algorithm)"

## external algorithm

 - removed references to \cite{AltetiAbad2007}
 - removed phrase "The time complexity for building the CSI is higher than that of computing the \emph{argsort} operation, but the formal time complexity is not reported in the source \cite{AltetiAbad2007}"

# Results
## GPU K-Means

 - removed "Whenever the number of clusters was superior to $70\%$ of the number of patterns (e.g. 800 clusters for a dataset with 1000 pattern), that particular test case was not executed."

## Validation
 - changed some phrases
 - changed title to "Validation with original"

## Big study
 - changed to subsubtitles for reduced font size
 - changed title to "Association density" to occupy only 1 line
 - removed phrases
 - changed phrases
