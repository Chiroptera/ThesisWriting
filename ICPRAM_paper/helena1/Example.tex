\abstract{The unprecedented collection and storage of data in electronic format has given rise to an interested in automated analysis for generation of knowledge and new insights.
Cluster analysis is a good candidate since it makes as few assumptions about the data as possible.
A vast body of work on clustering methods exist, yet, typically, no single method is able to respond to the specificities of all kinds of data.
Evidence Accumulation Clustering (EAC) is a robust state of the art ensemble algorithm that has shown good results.
However, this robustness comes with higher computational cost.
Currently, its application is slow or restricted to small datasets.
The objective of the present work is to scale EAC, allowing its applicability to big datasets, with technology available at a typical workstation.
Three approaches for different parts of EAC are presented: a parallel GPU K-Means implementation, a novel strategy to build a sparse CSR matrix specialized to EAC and Single-Link based on Minimum Spanning Trees using an external memory sorting algorithm.
Combining these approaches, the application of EAC to much larger datasets than before possible was accomplished.}

\section{\uppercase{Conclusions}}
\label{sec:conc}
The main goal of scaling the EAC method for larger datasets than was previously possible was achieved.
In the process, it was also optimized for smaller datasets.
The EAC method is composed by three steps and, to scale the whole method, each step was optimized separately but maintaining interoperability.
In essence, the main contributions to the EAC method, by step, were the GPU parallel K-Means in the production step, the EAC CSR strategy in the combination step and the SL-MST-Disk in the recovery step.
These contributions together allow for the application of the EAC method to datasets whose complexity was not handled by the original implementation.

Further work involves thorough evaluation in real world.deproblems and datasets.
Additional work may include further optimization of the Parallel GPU K-means by using shared memory and a better sorting of the co-association graph in the \emph{SL-MST-Disk}.
By using using bigger chunks in main memory and possibly even using the GPU, sorting the co-association graph should become significantly faster.
