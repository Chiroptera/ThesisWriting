\section{Experimental environment}
\label{sec:system configs}

All experiments were carried out in one of three distinct machines that will be referred to as \textbf{Alpha}, \textbf{Bravo} and \textbf{Charlie}.
Their CPU and GPU hardware configurations are described in Tables \ref{tab:alpha}, \ref{tab:bravo} and \ref{tab:charlie}, respectively.
Besides, Charlie has a \emph{Seagate ST2000DM001} 7200 RPM spinning disk and a \emph{Samsung 840 EVO} Solid State Drive, informations relevant for the third phase of EAC.% with sequential read/write speeds of up to 540/410 MB/s.

Software wise, all machines are running Linux based operating systems.
Alpha and Bravo are using the Ubuntu 14.04 and 12.04, respectively, with a graphical interface.
Whether the machine is running a graphical interface or not is important because the amount of time a GPU kernel can take when the GPU is being used as a display device is severely constrained. %, in the case that it only has one GPU (as is the case with all the machines here presented) the available memory for computation is less than total and there is a limit to how long a CUDA kernel can be executed.
Charlie is running Fedora 21 without a graphical interface.
